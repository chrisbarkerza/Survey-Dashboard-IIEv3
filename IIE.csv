I‚Äôd love for the institution to support this further by giving us secure access, some clear guidelines, and training so staff and students can use it confidently, and by looking at ways to build it into our learning systems so everyone can benefit.","I see real potential for generative AI to ease workload pressures, strengthen student support, and drive innovation. For example, AI could help predict and balance staff workloads, identify at-risk students through early performance analytics, etc It could also streamline administration by drafting routine correspondence and generating feedback templates for lecturers to adapt, saving time while keeping quality high. Longer-term, an AI hub for sharing best practices and even policy simulation tools could support evidence-based decision-making. To make this feasible, we would need secure system integration, clear ethical guidelines, and practical training so staff can confidently adopt these tools.","I see scope for developing AI agents that act as autonomous co-pilots in key areas of faculty management. For instance, a Workload Balancer Agent could integrate timetables, HR data, and assessment schedules to proactively redistribute workloads and flag bottlenecks. A Student Success Agent could monitor LMS activity, attendance, and assessment performance to generate early alerts and personalised support suggestions for at-risk students. An Admin Automation Agent could manage routine queries, draft correspondence, and coordinate external moderation processes. Integration with existing systems (HR, LMS, accreditation databases) would be essential, and challenges such as data privacy, ethical oversight, and staff adoption would need to be managed. Over time, these agents could evolve from simply automating tasks to offering predictive insights and scenario simulations, ultimately boosting both productivity and decision-making across the faculty.","Training (e.g., workshops, webinars, on-demand videos or courses to build skills in using GenAi tools).;License/subscription fees (e.g., financial support or subsidies to cover the costs of accessing premium GenAi tools).;Approved apps list and access (e.g., a curated list of recommended GenAi apps with provided institutional access or accounts).;Technical Support (e.g., troubleshooting, setup, or integration of GenAi tools).;Resource Materials (e.g., guides, tutorials, or documentation on using GenAi tools effectively).;Community or Peer Support (e.g., access to forums, study groups, or mentors for collaboration and knowledge-sharing)."

With institutional support in the form of training, reliable platforms, and clear ethical guidelines, these applications could be scaled and used more effectively to enhance both staff and student success","One idea I would find useful is a GenAi tool that could automatically align my lecture content and assessments with curriculum outcomes, saving time while ensuring compliance. I would also value an AI-driven system that generates personalised student feedback based on their specific progress and learning style. Another helpful tool would be an AI assistant to streamline administrative tasks such as timetabling, reporting, and communication. With the right institutional support and ethical safeguards, these ideas could free up more of my time for meaningful student engagement and research.","I would benefit from an AI agent that could act as a teaching assistant, helping manage routine tasks like marking short-answer assessments, generating feedback, and tracking student progress. Another useful agent could be a research companion that scans new publications in my field, summarises key insights, and highlights gaps aligned with my interests. An administrative AI agent to handle scheduling, reporting, and communication would also ease my workload and free time for higher-value tasks. If these agents were thoughtfully integrated with institutional systems and guided by clear ethical frameworks, they could greatly enhance productivity and student support.","Training (e.g., workshops, webinars, on-demand videos or courses to build skills in using GenAi tools).;License/subscription fees (e.g., financial support or subsidies to cover the costs of accessing premium GenAi tools).;Approved apps list and access (e.g., a curated list of recommended GenAi apps with provided institutional access or accounts).;Technical Support (e.g., troubleshooting, setup, or integration of GenAi tools)."

The biggest support would be for the institution to catch up and develop an Open Education movement that can support CoPs and educational resource and practice sharing. Reconsider CoP networks (an LMS/ARC is not an effective platform as it is less permanent than Microsoft) and better data repositories and curation/sharing practices. SharePoint could work but requires QA/oversight (librarians to assist in curating and maintaining). ARCs LOR could also work but that will need well-organised training, teamwork & commitment by Librarians and Academic Support Teams.
The only way I see to further enhance effectiveness, scalability (across lecturers/staff), or alignment with tasks/goals using GenAi is to increase time/reduce work duties (often redundant admin tasks and overly complex or outdated workflow processes) that get in the way. The institution over the last 2 years has been adding too many extra duties (admin/QA tasks) that are overloading campuses already constrained capacities - this effects our ability to focus on quality (instead of the tick box that we often see presented) CoPs, research and innovation. With a lack of capacity there is an increase in unofficial overtime that academics are doing (beyond what they have already being doing) to explore and develop their education practices with GenAi (i.e., unpaid labour). The institution needs to increase campus capacity by reviewing roles to reduce work duties, or to increase capacity/budgets for new roles - i.e., campus Academic Integrity teams, a campus academic researcher position (not an extra role/task/duty). This will lighted the already constrained academic teams for time to research, test and develop new (and potentially innovative or critical) practices of using GenAi for various educational or admin tasks.","It is not so much GenAi uses but automation & updated workflow processes (too many middlemen - that are often not trained well-enough on how processes & systems interlink). For example, it is ridiculous that ""AIT"" has not assisted (campus-wide) in automating the plagiarism/disciplinary processes. Similarity with ""Care Calling"" as a redundant admin task [just 3rd-party or automate it with a survey or a Bot]. We already have personalised feedback mechanisms (i.e., at-risk conversations & lecturer-student check-ins). GenAi should be a minor focus compared to improving workflow processes, automation, and data curation (& knowledge management is a mess. I.e., SharePoint) [KonMari method needed].","Please consider the research on AI Agents. Meredith Whittaker for example has noted there are ""profound"" security risks. Automation? Hell yes! ... Agents? Let's be academically cautious by taking a socio-technical approach to technology rather than a technocratic one (and allow students/staffs to co-construct their technological ecologies for teaching and learning, alongside their right to refuse certain technologies, datafication & surveillance given the grave risks vs subpar benefits). We aren't a tech-bro company like Meta ""move fast and break things"". We are a higher education institution that should consider the research & actual harms, alongside a care towards students, staff & society/environment over the hype of GenAi. It's worrying to see divergence away from some of our IIE goals (i.e., Holistic Thinkers, Change Advocates) towards a path of late neolibralism (metrics & efficiency) rather than broader goals of social responsibility (i.e., UN SDGs).","Approved apps list and access (e.g., a curated list of recommended GenAi apps with provided institutional access or accounts).;Resource Materials (e.g., guides, tutorials, or documentation on using GenAi tools effectively).;Community or Peer Support (e.g., access to forums, study groups, or mentors for collaboration and knowledge-sharing).;Other (please specify any additional assistance not covered above)."

It would be incredibly beneficial for staff to have a similar tool. In my role, I work with disciplinaries and often need to consult lengthy policy documents. Having a bot that could instantly provide accurate answers would save significant time. For example, I could quickly find the outcome for a student caught with narcotics on campus, what the policy says on 'searching students‚Äô bags, or our position on promoting political parties etc. It could also answer questions such as how many leave days VC staff are entitled to. By providing instant, accurate information, such a tool would not only improve efficiency but also reduce risk and error.","Using the example above, there could be dedicated FAQ Bots for different functions, such as an HR FAQ Bot, a Disciplinary Officer FAQ Bot, and an Academic Operations FAQ Bot. Imagine an automated system where, if plagiarism is flagged, both the staff member and the student receive an immediate notice. The staff member could also be provided with a recommended sanction level and a likely outcome, based on policy, once the investigation is complete.

Through concept development, literature reviews, and summarizing, it can increase the productivity of research.  Faculty and staff can save a great deal of time by streamlining administrative duties including writing emails, reports, and proposals.  GenAi promotes creativity and experimentation in creative fields by assisting with writing, design, and media production.  To guarantee that all students and employees have equitable access to these advantages, I would like the school to make investments in ethical AI training, infrastructure, and access.","To cut down on manual tracking, one solution is a GenAi-powered assistant that automatically arranges and condenses meeting notes, action items, and follow-ups.  Another would be a program that uses data inputs and real-time project updates to generate reports or documentation.  In order to save time and guarantee consistent communication, a chatbot that has been trained on institutional policies could respond to common inquiries from coworkers or students.  AI-powered scheduling aides that manage several calendars would also make teamwork easier.  All things considered, these technologies would lessen monotonous work and free up more time for strategic or creative endeavors.","An AI academic coach that assists with homework planning, deadline management, and study strategy recommendations based on individual learning styles is one concept.  For essays or projects, a research assistant agent could aid with discovering pertinent sources, summarizing results, and keeping track of citations.  An AI project manager might assign tasks, give reminders, and keep track of progress for group projects.

This would also help lecturers as well to understand how to look for loopholes where students are using AI tools to generate answers. Lecturers would be able to engage with students before the work is completed, and help students understand that we know when something is not right, especially for Assignment submissions. ","When brainstorming, it is important to not ask AI for the complete solution, but to use it effectively to build a solution, step-by-step. It helps to align and focus a conversation that develops a solution over time and helps the person understand better, how a solution came to be. ","It would be interesting to help both lecturers and students use the AI tool to evaluate assignments based on the marking criteria. The feedback given to a student can help them sometimes better understand the comments made by a lecturer after an assignment is marked. This idea could help the lecturer to better see the assignment, in a better light. Helping them to provide and when needed, understand the right feedback that could assist the student (deeper thinking, more thoughtful feedback) instead of stating that something is just wrong.

Instead, I have taught my students to focus on both generative and non-generative AI tools that specialise in certain aspects of the educational process. For example, I have made it mandatory in most ICE Tasks to make use of AI tools such as Litmaps or Connected papers for source finding, as well as Notebook LM for source engagement. In doing so, I am showing my students how to make AI useful to them as a tool for learning, for exploration, for reading, and for source synthesis so that they can still do their own evaluations, critical thinking, reflective practive and writing. This is something that I would like the institution to focus on - to provide frameworks on AI tools that are suited to enhacing skills rather than generating all the content, and to focus on supporting student integration of AI skillsets. For instance, I am busy with a paper that focuses on constructing a framework of guidelines and principles for ethical and effective student AI use so that I can use the findings to support my students in learning such AI literacy. ","I have been lucky enough to receive full CoPilot Pro access to streamline my research output as well as my teaching and learning. This access has been a tremendous help in getting through tasks faster, providing me the time to critically engage with the more important aspects of my tasks and have allowed me to get through more of my work in shorter time frames. I have also made it a point to constantly use Notebook LM, Gamma AI, and SciSpace as tools to help with presentation construction (to get a basic outline to edit and enhance), literature reviews for research (to manage and synthesis my reading of large amounts of information and articles), and to streamline my narrative construction processes. If services like these were to be integrated for all academic staff, I believe it would truly benefit the institution and would allow academic staff the additional time to focus on research output. For instance, in having these tools, I am working on 3 papers this year alone, with the likelihood of publishing two this year and one in the first half of next year - as an example. ","AI Agents are already accessible to staff if they make use of their MS365 Copilot. Microsoft recently made agents available for free use, which is helpful as it allows for the creation of policy category agents, and so forth. However, it is the creation of such CoPilot agents that can be tricky for people the first couple times. If sufficient how to guides or training were provided, staff and students could make use of CoPilot agents for academic policy, module specific guidelines (based on Module Outlines, etc), and so forth. This would further allow for staff to gain time that would have been spent querying policy, and would assist the student relations center with enquiring less student queries that require deeper module specific investigation.

Furthermore, AI could act as a supervision tracker by analysing student writing progress to flag methodological gaps, consistency issues, or timeline delays. A programme coordinator's aid could be provided by generating real-time analytics dashboards from LMS/evaluation data to identify course performance trends and resource gaps, a training tool by simulating complex supervisee queries or ethical dilemmas for practice, and a research catalyst by identifying potential collaborators through publication/method analysis. ","In the research domain, a generative research companion could supercharge literature review and writing. For instance, an AI assistant could search academic databases, identify high‚Äëvalue psychology papers, extract key findings and quotes, and even draft summaries or reports. Tools like Elicit already show the promise, for instance, AI‚Äëenabled systematic reviews can cut review time, quickly surface relevant studies that might be missed by manual search and provide transparent citations for every claim. Adapting such a model to the lecturer‚Äôs speciality (fine‚Äëtuned on psychology journals and local research outputs) would help the academic discover new angles, generate hypotheses, and draft literature reviews far faster. Technical feasibility is strong since large‚Äëscale research databases exist; the main requirements are API access or integrated search of PsycINFO/PubMed and ensuring up‚Äëto‚Äëdate information. The payoff is higher research productivity and enhanced teaching.","Training (e.g., workshops, webinars, on-demand videos or courses to build skills in using GenAi tools).;License/subscription fees (e.g., financial support or subsidies to cover the costs of accessing premium GenAi tools).;Approved apps list and access (e.g., a curated list of recommended GenAi apps with provided institutional access or accounts).;Technical Support (e.g., troubleshooting, setup, or integration of GenAi tools).;Resource Materials (e.g., guides, tutorials, or documentation on using GenAi tools effectively)."

It has also been valuable for summarising complex texts, eg. summarising the South African Schools Act etc.  and rephrasing explanations into simpler, student-friendly language. These applications have improved both the quality of teaching resources and the efficiency with which they are produced. With institutional support, these uses could be enhanced significantly. For example, access to an institution-wide GenAi platform integrated with our LMS would allow lecturers and students to use the tool within a secure, ethical framework. Training workshops could help ensure that staff and students understand not only how to use GenAi effectively but also how to avoid pitfalls such as plagiarism or over-reliance. Institutional investment in resources such as clear usage policies would also ensure equitable access for all. This support would allow GenAi to be used more ethically, aligning with our goals of fostering innovation, improving student learning outcomes, and promoting digital literacy.
","Institutional support in the form of training, ethical guidelines, and integrated AI platforms would make these tools more effective, saving staff time while improving consistency, innovation, and student support.","One useful AI agent could be a Marking Assistant, trained on institutional rubrics, that pre-scores assignments, highlights strengths and weaknesses, and generates draft feedback for moderation‚Äîsaving time while maintaining academic integrity.

Using AI to help comprehend subjects and to open up more possibilities when it comes to research, strategy and creativity. AI is also a fantastic creative tool in that it can very quickly bring ideas to life, and also combine disparate ideas to create something new. The emphasis here, is it is a tool - use it but add human understanding and empathy and, where possible, show evidence of the hand of the maker. I believe we need to update our education system/s to accommodate the Age of AI, rather than try and fight it and find ways to catch students out. Use AI as building blocks in education and life, facilitate clever uses of AI in conjunction with other methods of learning and creating, and open up the opportunities for provocative questions and insightful discussions that ensure a deeper understanding on the part of the students. Likewise, as a lecturer, be free to mash up your tools and techniques when putting together learning material and activities in class. Just as we use prompts to get results from AI, AI and also be used as prompts to expand understanding, encourage more in-depth research and discussion, and so on. ","I have been experimenting with AI for several years and have frequently shared examples of my private creative work utilising AI, as well as new AI platforms, powerful prompts, etc. I have done this with students and colleagues. Given talks on the topic to students and colleagues, both on my campus and to other campuses via online guest sessions at conferences. Whilst I am a strong ambassador for AI, I don't think it is an either/or situation. It should never take over from bespoke creativity, critical thinking and ideation, but it can facilitate certain processes and is useful for filling in for certain skillsets that someone may not have, and for making certain tasks easier. That said, when it comes to ideation, I will always advocate for the power of the human imagination, and the use of a pen and paper (laptops and phones off!). It is up to the lecturers to ensure this, especially when dealing with a generation that often appears to lack initiative, and where all answers appear to reside on Pinterest. ","In a personal capacity, I am about to experiment with AI agents to code and create apps that will be useful and save time. I am sure AI agents could be used as search engines, for SEO, certain marking and rubric creation, creating quizzes, collecting data, and so on. Mind mapping would be useful for both students and lecturers. The creation or, at least, initial thinking behind lesson planners, prompts, presentations, and so on.

For example, I often use GenAi to quickly explain complex networking concepts, generate practice labs in Packet Tracer, and create adaptive study guides for certifications like CCNA, ITIL, or Linux. It has also helped me draft professional reports, CVs, and proposals with clarity and structure, reducing the time spent on formatting and repetitive writing. In IT support tasks, GenAi assists with step-by-step troubleshooting guides and even suggests scripts or commands that speed up problem resolution. However, these benefits are currently limited by access to tools, lack of integration with institutional systems, and concerns about data accuracy and security. If the institution could support and enhance GenAi through dedicated platforms, integration with lab environments, and safe access to internal resources, students and staff would be able to scale their productivity significantly. Centralized AI infrastructure could also ensure outputs are aligned with curriculum standards and compliance frameworks. With institutional backing, GenAi could evolve from being an occasional helper into a trusted, everyday assistant that improves learning outcomes, operational efficiency, and career readiness for both staff and students.",Yes‚ÄîI can think of a few original GenAi concepts that could make my current (ICT support and networking-focused) role easier by removing bottlenecks and adding smart automation:,"AI agents could significantly enhance productivity and learning at the institution by serving as autonomous lab assistants that configure and troubleshoot networking labs, intelligent tutors that create adaptive study materials for CCNA, Linux, or ITIL, and virtual helpdesk agents that resolve routine IT support issues while escalating complex ones. They could also function as career coaches, analyzing student skills and aligning them with job opportunities, and as security agents that continuously monitor systems for vulnerabilities and compliance gaps. While integration with existing platforms like Packet Tracer, LMS, and ITSM tools would maximize impact, challenges such as ensuring data security, avoiding over-reliance, and aligning outputs with curriculum or workplace standards must be addressed; over time, these agents could evolve into more advanced systems that not only automate processes but also provide predictive insights, self-healing capabilities, and personalized pathways for both academic and career growth.","Training (e.g., workshops, webinars, on-demand videos or courses to build skills in using GenAi tools).;License/subscription fees (e.g., financial support or subsidies to cover the costs of accessing premium GenAi tools).;Approved apps list and access (e.g., a curated list of recommended GenAi apps with provided institutional access or accounts).;Technical Support (e.g., troubleshooting, setup, or integration of GenAi tools).;Resource Materials (e.g., guides, tutorials, or documentation on using GenAi tools effectively).;Community or Peer Support (e.g., access to forums, study groups, or mentors for collaboration and knowledge-sharing).;Other (please specify any additional assistance not covered above)."

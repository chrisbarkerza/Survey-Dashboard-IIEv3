      "I have found GenAi very useful in my work as a lecturer and researcher, particularly for designing engaging learning activities, reframing complex concepts, and drafting feedback for students. It has also supported my research by helping me brainstorm questions, refine abstracts, and synthesise large volumes of literature more efficiently. On the administrative side, I use it to draft communication and prepare outlines, which saves time and allows me to focus more on teaching and mentoring.

      "Many of my research & teaching tasks with GenAi are self-sufficient/explanatory and can be done via freemium applications. The biggest support would be for the institution to catch up and develop an Open Education movement that can support CoPs and educational resource and practice sharing. Reconsider CoP networks (an LMS/ARC is not an effective platform as it is less permanent than Microsoft) and better data repositories and curation/sharing practices. SharePoint could work but requires QA/oversight (librarians to assist in curating and maintaining). ARCs LOR could also work but that will need well-organised training, teamwork & commitment by Librarians and Academic Support Teams.\nThe only way I see to further enhance effectiveness, scalability (across lecturers/staff), or alignment with tasks/goals using GenAi is to increase time/reduce work duties (often redundant admin tasks and overly complex or outdated workflow processes) that get in the way. The institution over the last 2 years has been adding too many extra duties (admin/QA tasks) that are overloading campuses already constrained capacities - this effects our ability to focus on quality (instead of the tick box that we often see presented) CoPs, research and innovation. With a lack of capacity there is an increase in unofficial overtime that academics are doing (beyond what they have already being doing) to explore and develop their education practices with GenAi (i.e., unpaid labour). The institution needs to increase campus capacity by reviewing roles to reduce work duties, or to increase capacity/budgets for new roles - i.e., campus Academic Integrity teams, a campus academic researcher position (not an extra role/task/duty). This will lighted the already constrained academic teams for time to research, test and develop new (and potentially innovative or critical) practices of using GenAi for various educational or admin tasks.",

It has also helped me draft professional reports, CVs, and proposals with clarity and structure, reducing the time spent on formatting and repetitive writing. In IT support tasks, GenAi assists with step-by-step troubleshooting guides and even suggests scripts or commands that speed up problem resolution. However, these benefits are currently limited by access to tools, lack of integration with institutional systems, and concerns about data accuracy and security.
